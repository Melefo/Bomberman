# Bomberman

Bomberman is a project where we try to do an Bomberman-like game with a ECS and a Raylib encapsulation

***

## Installation

You can build yourself the program by cloning the repository : ``git clone https://github.com/EpitechIT2020/B-YEP-400-NAN-4-1-indiestudio-victor.trencic.git``

After going inside the repository directory, create a build folder ``mkdir build``, go inside and make ``cmake ..`` to finally make ``make bomberman`` on Linux or make ``cmake --build . --target bomberman`` on Windows. If you've done nothing wrong, you should have the program compiled!
